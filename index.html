<h3><a href="#">What is Audacity and why are we using it?</a></h3>
<div>
<p>Audacity is a piece of open source multi-track audio editing software. What does that mean? Because Audacity is open source, it's free for anyone, and cross-platform compatible, meaning you can run it Macs, PCs, and Unix systems. Translated into PC: Unlike your VRF, you can definitely run this baby on your own machine.</p>
<p>As a multi-track audio editor it allows you to record or import audio sources into separate tracks and then manipulate them. You can modify their length, quality, tone, pitch, etc. You can mix multiple tracks of speech and/or music to produce something resembling a... Radio Show! And that's why we're interested in it.</p>
<p>The following guide is an attempt to take anyone who's never used Audacity and have them ready to produce a show. Trust me, it's simple, and most of it's about repetition. Audacity has the power to produce complex and sophisticated projects, but you need a handful of operations to make clean radio broadcast you can be proud of. Jump right in.</p>

<h3><a href="#">Installing Audacity</a></h3>
<div>
<img src="images/audacity_open.png" border="0" alt="Opening shot of Audacity">
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the website (audacity.sourceforge.net) and download the latest version of Audacity. This should be version 1.3.12-beta (at the time of this writing). Do make sure that you get the beta version. This manual assumes you are working with version 1.3.12-beta or higher. Select your operating system to get the correct install files. Unix users can also get Audacity through their package management system, in which case ignore the following.</li>
		<li>Save it to your computer.</li>
		<li>Run the install file (.exe for windows) to install the program to your computer.</li>
		<li>Save the install file to pass on to friends!</li>
		<li>Run Audacity immediately to make sure it worked before moving on.</li>
	</ol>
</div>
<h3><a href="#">Install the LAME MP3 encoder</a></h3>
<div>
<p>In order to export finished projects as mp3 files (which are much smaller, and therefore more efficient to be moving around, you need to download the LAME mp3 codec. Luckily, this little gem is free and easy to use.</p>
<h3>Windows</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Go to the website (lame.buanzo.com.ar) and download the latest version (currently v3.98.3) of the LAME mp3 audio codec, listed under 'for Audacity on Windows'.</li>
		<li>Save it to your computer.</li>
		<li>Install it.</li>
		<li>Restart Audacity; you're good to go!</li>
	</ol>

<h3><a href="#">Connecting your Microphone</a></h3>
<div>	<ol>
		<li>Connect your device.</li>
		<li>Ensure the mic and headphone connections are made correctly.</li>
		<li>Check to make sure your device is working.</li>
	</ol></div>
<h3><a href="#">Setting Levels</a></h3>
<div>	
<p>In my experience, the number one factor for producing a quality piece of audio is setting up your microphone prior to recording. Once you've got a piece of poorly recorded audio, there's no amount of editing in the world that can make it sound half as good as a poorly-edited well-recorded track. Taking the time to set up your microphone properly, as well as your subject (whether it's you, another PCV, or a farmer in a village), will ensure a hassle free editing process and in the end, save you time. Trust me.</p>
<p>So what does it mean to set levels? Imagine for a moment, if you will, that the audio signal you're working with is water, and your tools are valves. We want good water pressure at the faucet (our completed project). Our goal is to maintain water pressure throughout the system, with no spikes or drops. If our source is too low or too high, we're going to have to modify the signal with our valves, which is inefficient, and unlike water, our signal will suffer a loss of quality.</p>
<p>Let's look at it from this perspective: over what do we have the most control? Our final exported file from Audacity, right? By then we've had the chance to play with all of our options, mixed everything to taste. Over what do we have the least control? Our source. We talk. We have no settings. Some people are louder, some quieter, but that's about it (this is obviously a simplification). For this reason, we want to start setting our levels with our source, and then our microphone, all the way up the line to our export options.</p>
<p>Here's how to get the most from your setup:</p>
<ol><img src="images/setting_levels1.png" border="0" alt="Setting levels using Audacity's monitoring function">
		<li>Open Audacity.</li>
		<li>Open Edit -> Preferences and select appropriate devices. Make sure the right Interface is selected, as well as your input and output devices. If you're using a skype headset, go ahead and select 1 (Mono) from the Channels menu. Close the preferences window.</li>
		<li>Begin monitoring by clicking the microphone icon underneach the right-hand set of meters, towards the upper left corner of the screen.</li>
		<li>Begin speaking into the microphone as you will be for your recording. NOTE: it is extremely important that your source be accurate. Speak as you will actually be speaking. If you are recording someone else, it is important that you set your levels while monitoring them.</li>
		<img src="images/setting_levels2.png" border="0" alt="">
		<li>Our goal going forward is to get our signal (represented by the lights which move in response to signal input) to go as high as possible without actually reaching the right hand edge of the meters. If it does touch them, that is called clipping, and will resort in a distorted 'clipped' sounding blip in the recording. These cannot be fixed later. They can be cut out completely, but not corrected. Because no one wants clipping, Audacity has handily made it so that if a clip occurs, small bars at the far right of the meters turn red, and stay red. This means you've got a clip. Unless it was an accident, you know you need to change a setting before actually recording.</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Begin with the settings on the device itself. This is key.</li>
			<li>then adjust recording levels in your computer audio settings (win,mac,lin)</li>
			<li>make sure there will be no clipping, using the loudest sound as a test sound</li>
			<li>make sure that the level is as loud as you can get it without clipping</li>
		</ol>
	</ol>

<h3><a href="#">Select Track Type</a></h3>
<div>	
	<!-- <img src="images/select_track.png" width="1024" height="552" border="0" alt=""> -->
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to Tracks -> Add New ->  and add your track of choice</li>
		<li>Choices: Audio Track, Stereo Track, Label Track, Time Track</li>
		<li>Audio Track</li>
		<ol>
			<li>This is a mono track, meaning that there will be one channel recorded, which will be played out of all speakers connected to the radio receiver.</li>
			<li>pros: smaller file size, easier to see multiple waveforms in detail on small screens</li>
			<li>cons: lack of stereo audio (sounds less natural), doesn't match music recordings</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Stereo Track</li>
		<ol>
			<li>This is a stereo track, </li>
			<li>pros: sounds better, matches music files</li>
			<li>cons: larger file size, more difficult to work with on small screens</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Label and Time Tracks</li>
		<ul>
			<li>These are more advanced functions covered later in the manual. For more information, see the Advanced Exporting section.</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Choose mono:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>our audience is listening to broadcasts on small portable radios, for the most part</li>
			<li>depending on the radio station, they may only broadcast in mono</li>
			<li>with small exception (zoom audio recorder) we only have mono mics</li>
			<li>file sizes small, facilitating transferring them to the station</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Select Tracks -> Add New -> Audio Track</li>
